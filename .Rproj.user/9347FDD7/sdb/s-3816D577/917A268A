    "contents" : "#' This scores a given subscale and outputs a data frame with one column containing all subjects' scores.\n#'\n#' @param dataFrame A data frame containing the appropriate measure items.\n#' @param forwItems A vector of the items that should be forward-scored.\n#' @param revItems A vector of the items that should be reverse scored. Default is NULL in case there are no reverse-scored items.\n#' @param revInt A number (usually an integer, but does not have to be integer type) that will be used to reverse score the reverse-scored items by subtracting the subject-entered item value from the revInt. For example, if the items are on a 1-7 Likert scale, the revInt would be 8 (because 8-1 is 7, 8-7 is 1, etc.); if the items are on a 0-4 Likert scale, the revInt would be 4. In general the revint is the maximum of the Likert scale if it starts at zero, or is 1 greater than the max if it starts at 1. Default is NULL in case there are no reverse scored items.\n#' @param idxOfSubj A numeric index giving the position in the original data frame that contains the subject IDs. Default is 1. If the subject IDs are the row names of the original data frame, change this to 0.\n#' @return A data frame with two columns: one containing subject IDs, the other containing the scores for each subject.\n#' @export\n\ncalcSubscale <- function(dataFrame, forwItems, revItems = NULL, revInt = NULL, idxOfSubj = 1){\n  #creates a data frame just of the items to be forward scored; note that this does not include subject names\n  forwScorDf <- dataFrame[,forwItems]\n  #creates a data frame with one column of zeroes with a length corresponding to the number of subjects/observations\n  revScorDf <- data.frame(zeroes = rep(0,times=nrow(dataFrame)))\n  #checks if anything has been supplied to the revItems argument, if it is length greater than zero, and if so whether the first element is something other than NA, in that order\n  if(!is.null(revItems) && length(revItems > 0L) && !is.na(revItems[1])){\n    #creates a data frame just of the items to be reverse scored\n      revScorDf <- dataFrame[,revItems]\n      #reverse scores the reverse scored items by subtracting each value from the given number\n      revScorDf <- revInt - revScorDf\n  }\n  #creates a data frame with two columns: for first column, just has subject IDs; for second column, sums across the forward and reverse scored items to create a total data frame (if there are no reverse-scored items, zero is added to each row)\n  totalDf <- cbind(dataFrame[idxOfSubj], as.data.frame(rowSums(forwScorDf) + rowSums(revScorDf), stringsAsFactors = F))\n  #renames the second column as \"total\"\n  names(totalDf)[2] <- \"Total\"\n  #returns the data frame\n  return(totalDf)\n}\n",
